# Understanding Neural Networks and deep Neural Networks

## Introduction

In this post, I’ll walk through what I’ve learned about **fully connected neural networks** and ****. 

These are foundational components of deep learning architectures. The concepts are drawn from the lecture slides and the fastai course and my interpretation of "how things work".

## Fully Connected Neural Networks (FCNs) !!

A **fully connected neural network**, also known as a **fully connected perceptron!**, connects each input node to every node in the next layer. An example given in ELEC4360 lecture slides is a 2 layer network as for image classification as follows:
